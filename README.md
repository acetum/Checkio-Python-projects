This was a tough one for me. I hadn't encoutered sets yet and wasn't sure how to iterate through them. I spent a long time trying to split the coordinates into separate entities but finally realized I could iterate through them and use the index to get to the coordinate I needed.

There are much easier and more elegant ways of doing what I did, from the other solutions I've seen but they all use concepts I don't know yet. So yeah, lots to learn!
